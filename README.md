# Acknowledgements
This follows many of the concepts taught in Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, however significantly expands on them with more views, more complex filters, etc. The process of obtaining dynamic backgrounds on show pages come from here: https://medium.com/swlh/swiftui-read-the-average-color-of-an-image-c736adb43000, but is adapated to fit my project.
