# TVShowApp

This is a side project of mine to experiment with iOS development. It is intended for personal use and replaces my old form of keeping track of TV shows I am watching. It allows for different filters, interesting visuals, and data manipulation. Because it was intended for personal use it uses local file reading/writing for data storage.

# Current TODO:
- Improving saving function
- Navigation bar overhaul
- Make "Status" an enum
- Add ability to delete show

# Acknowledgements
This follows many of the concepts taught in Apple's SwiftUI and IOS tutorials, however significantly expands on them with more views, more complex filters, etc. The process of obtaining dynamic backgrounds on show pages come from here: https://medium.com/swlh/swiftui-read-the-average-color-of-an-image-c736adb43000, but is adapated to fit my project.
