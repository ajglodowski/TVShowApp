# TVShowApp

This is a side project of mine to experiment with iOS development. It is intended for personal use and replaces my old form of keeping track of TV shows I am watching. It allows for different filters, interesting visuals, and data manipulation. Because it was intended for personal use it uses local file reading/writing for data storage.

# Current TODO:
- Get saving to json file
- Navigation fixes
- Navigation bar overhaul
- Make "Status" an enum

# Known Bugs:
- Navigation after editing shows is wrong

# Past TODO:
- Add Show Service filter
- Add Show Length Feature
- Add new "Undiscovered" show type
- Add new show tile for homepage
- Fix / Add applied filters buttons on appropriate screens
- Add edit feature
- Update ShowDetail to have dynamic background

# Acknowledgements
This follows many of the concepts taught in Apple's SwiftUI tutorials, however significantly expands on them with more views, more complex filters, etc. The process of obtaining dynamic backgrounds on show pages come from here: https://medium.com/swlh/swiftui-read-the-average-color-of-an-image-c736adb43000, but is adapated to fit my project.
